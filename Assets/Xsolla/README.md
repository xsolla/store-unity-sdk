> Integrate [Xsolla Mobile SDK](https://developers.xsolla.com/sdk/mobile/) to enable In-App Payments across mobile platforms within and outside of stores in a platform-compliant way, powered by Pay Station with over 700 payment methods.

# Enterprise-level Xsolla SDK for Unity


The SDK makes it easier to integrate Xsolla products into your Unity project by providing out-of-the-box data structures and methods for working with Xsolla API.

After integration, you can use Xsolla products to:

* authenticate users
* manage in-game purchases and player inventory in your application
* set up payment methods
* sell subscriptions

To start with the SDK, you need to install this asset and set up a project in [Xsolla Publisher Account](https://publisher.xsolla.com/signup?utm_source=sdk&utm_medium=unity-store/).

**INFO:** Starting with SDK version 2.5.5, you can also use the [Ready-to-use store](https://developers.xsolla.com/sdk/ready-to-use-store/) module — a ready-made solution with a pre-configured UI and logic for user authorization, catalog display, and item purchase.

[Go to the integration guide →](https://developers.xsolla.com/sdk/unity/)

## Requirements

### System requirements

* 64-bit OS
* Windows 7 SP1 and higher
* macOS 10.12 and higher
* Minimum supported version of Unity — 2021.3.56f2

### Target OS

* macOS
* Windows 64-bit
* Android
* iOS

Additionally, the asset supports [creating WebGL build](https://developers.xsolla.com/sdk/unity/how-tos/application-build/#unity_sdk_how_to_build_webgl) to run your application in a browser.

For mobile platforms, we recommend integrating [Xsolla Mobile SDK](https://developers.xsolla.com/sdk/mobile/).

**NOTE:** We recommend you use the Mono compiler for desktop platforms as it’s compatible with the provided in-game browser. If you use other browser solutions, you can use the IL2CPP compiler instead. You can use either Mono or IL2CPP compilers to create game builds for Android.


## Install SDK

### Import package from an archive

1. [Download the latest SDK version](https://github.com/xsolla/store-unity-sdk/raw/refs/heads/master/xsolla-unity-sdk-latest.unitypackage) (recommended) or choose the required SDK version on [GitHub](https://github.com/xsolla/store-unity-sdk/releases) and download it.

2. Unzip the package.

3. In the Unity editor, go to **Assets > Import Package > Custom Package** in the main menu and select the SDK.

4. Follow the [integration guide](https://developers.xsolla.com/sdk/unity/integrate-complete-solution/get-started/) to configure project on Xsolla side.

### Import package from git repository

**NOTE:**

For the package manager to work correctly, [git client](https://git-scm.com/) should be installed. For detailed information about the prerequisites for using the package manager, refer to the [Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html).

1. Open your Unity project or create a new one.

2. In the main menu, click **Window > Package Manager**.

3. Add a package as a dependence:

    a. Click the **+** icon and select  **Add package from git URL**.

    b. Specify the git repository URL: `https://github.com/xsolla/store-unity-sdk.git?path=Assets/Xsolla`.

    c. Click **Add** and wait for the import to finish.

## Usage

To send requests to Xsolla servers and receive responses, the SDK provides the `XsollaAuth`, `XsollaCatalog`, `XsollaCart`, and `XsollaOrders` classes. If you want to implement your own logic for buying items or inventory management, and don’t want to write boilerplate code for API calls, these classes are a good place to start.

You can use the [Ready-to-use store](https://developers.xsolla.com/sdk/ready-to-use-store/) module — a ready-made solution with a pre-configured UI and logic for user authorization, catalog display, and item purchase.

Follow the [step-by-step instructions](https://developers.xsolla.com/sdk/unity/integrate-complete-solution/integrate-on-app-side/#unity_sdk_integrate_on_app_side_quick_start) to implement the basic in-game sales scenario from scratch.
