The SDK makes it easier to integrate Xsolla products into your Unity project by providing out-of-the-box data structures and methods for working with Xsolla API.

After integration, you can use:

* [Login](https://developers.xsolla.com/doc/login/) for authenticating users and managing the friend system and user account.
* [In-Game Store](https://developers.xsolla.com/doc/in-game-store/) for managing in-game purchases and player inventory in your application.
* [Pay Station](https://developers.xsolla.com/doc/pay-station/) for setting up payments.

## Requirements

Additionally, the asset supports [creating WebGL build](https://developers.xsolla.com/sdk/unity/how-tos/application-build/#unity_sdk_how_to_build_webgl) to run your application in a browser.

**NOTE:**
We recommend you use the Mono compiler for desktop platforms as it’s compatible with the provided in-game browser. If you use other browser solutions, you can use the IL2CPP compiler instead.
You can use either Mono or IL2CPP compilers to create game builds for Android.

## Usage

To send requests to Xsolla servers and receive responses, the SDK provides the `XsollaAuth`, `XsollaCatalog`, `XsollaCart`, and `XsollaOrders` classes. If you want to implement your own logic for buying items or inventory management, and don’t want to write boilerplate code for API calls, these classes are a good place to start.

Follow the [step-by-step tutorials](https://developers.xsolla.com/sdk/unity/tutorials/) to get started with basic SDK features.
