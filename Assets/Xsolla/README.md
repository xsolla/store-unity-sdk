The SDK makes it easier to integrate Xsolla products into your Unity project by providing out-of-the-box data structures and methods for working with Xsolla API.

After integration, you can use:

* [Login](https://developers.xsolla.com/doc/login/) for authenticating users and managing the friend system and user account.
* [In-Game Store](https://developers.xsolla.com/doc/in-game-store/) for managing in-game purchases and player inventory in your application.
* [Pay Station](https://developers.xsolla.com/doc/pay-station/) for setting up payments.
* [Subscriptions](https://developers.xsolla.com/doc/subscriptions/) to provide users with access to a package of services under specified conditions (subscription cost and duration).

Additionally, the asset supports [creating WebGL build](https://developers.xsolla.com/sdk/unity/how-tos/application-build/#unity_sdk_how_to_build_webgl) to run your application in a browser.

**NOTE:**
We recommend you use the Mono compiler for desktop platforms as it’s compatible with the provided in-game browser. If you use other browser solutions, you can use the IL2CPP compiler instead.
You can use either Mono or IL2CPP compilers to create game builds for Android.

## Install SDK

### Import package from an archive

1. [Download the latest SDK version](https://github.com/xsolla/store-unity-sdk/raw/refs/heads/master/xsolla-unity-sdk-latest.unitypackage) (recommended) or choose the required SDK version on [GitHub](https://github.com/xsolla/store-unity-sdk/releases) and download it.
2. Unzip the package.
3. In the Unity editor, go to **Assets > Import Package > Custom Package** in the main menu and select the SDK.
4. Follow the [integration guide](https://developers.xsolla.com/sdk/unity/integrate-complete-solution/get-started/) to configure project on Xsolla side.

### Import package from git repository

**NOTE:**

For the package manager to work correctly, [git client](https://git-scm.com/) should be installed. For detailed information about the prerequisites for using the package manager, refer to the [Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html).

1. Open your Unity project or create a new one.
2. In the main menu, click **Window > Package Manager**.
3. Add a package as a dependence:
 a. Click the **+** icon and select  Add package from git URL.
 b. Specify the git repository URL: `https://github.com/xsolla/store-unity-sdk.git?path=Assets/Xsolla`.
 c. Click **Add** and wait for the import to finish.

## Usage

To send requests to Xsolla servers and receive responses, the SDK provides the `XsollaAuth`, `XsollaCatalog`, `XsollaCart`, and `XsollaOrders` classes. If you want to implement your own logic for buying items or inventory management, and don’t want to write boilerplate code for API calls, these classes are a good place to start.

Follow the [step-by-step tutorials](https://developers.xsolla.com/sdk/unity/tutorials/) to get started with basic SDK features.
